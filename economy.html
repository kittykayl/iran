      <p>Iran's' economy has rapidly increased during the 1960s and the 1970s. The government used oil production to make profit. With this profit, they made new businesses and industries. However the revolution that occurred in 1979 damaged Iran’s economy. Many well-skilled workers in Iran left because of the revolution and many factories shut down. Then, a war in the 1980s also damaged Iran and oil production and export was sharply decreased.</p>
      <p>Today, Iran’s economy is still centered around oil production, but services, mining, and farming play a major role now. Iran’s government has control over the oil industry and Iran has a high unemployment rate. Because of this, many educated people work overseas or away.</p>
